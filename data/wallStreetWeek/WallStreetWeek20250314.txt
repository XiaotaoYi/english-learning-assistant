This is "Wall Street Week."
I'm David Westin

bringing you
stories of capitalism.

This week, two tales
of second acts.

Netflix founder Reed Hastings

from the top of his
Powder Mountain,

where he is building
a private ski resort

for those looking for a little
less traffic on the slopes.

And from
Edna Valley, California,

former Raytheon CEO Bill Swanson

shows us how he is
combining his experience

running a major defense firm

with what his
Croatian grandfather

taught him about growing grapes.

But we start with
a story of reflection,

reflecting back on a time
only 5 short years ago,

when the coronavirus caused
one of the deadliest

pandemics in human history.

But with the world
back to normal,

we can now reflect on what
has changed, what has not,

and how the world can
better prepare itself

for the next time.

-I have decided to take
several strong but necessary

actions to protect the health
and well-being of all Americans.

We have issued guidance
on school closures,

social distancing,
and reducing large gatherings.

[Siren wailing]

Westin: Most of us remember
where we were

in mid-March of 2020--

a time of empty streets,
lockdowns,

and economic turmoil.

The S&P 500 slumped
close to 20% in one month.

The US economy simply came to
a stop almost overnight.

And initial jobless claims
surged to more than 6 million

in a matter of weeks.

-This blows away
even the forecasts.

Almost 6.7 million
this week.

It just goes to point out
how bad this is

for the overall US economy.

-Well, the global economy,
of course,

including the US and Europe,
got a huge shock.

Westin: Torsten Slok is
Apollo's chief economist.

-The shock created
quite some significant changes

for different sectors,

because when you suddenly had
in 2019

that the way
the economy was working

with services playing
a certain role,

goods playing a certain role,

and from one day to the other,

goods played
a much, much bigger role

because we were sitting at home
ordering things online

and services, we couldn't
go out to restaurants,

we couldn't go to theme parks,
we couldn't travel,

suddenly got a huge decline.

That change, of course,
played a significant role

in how the economy responded.

-Wash your hands off
or use hand sanitizer.

Westin: Two of the sectors
affected were travel...

-Pretty much every aspect
of travel changed.

I mean, it went off a cliff
for quite a while.

Westin: and health care.

-You know, I always say
trust is

the currency of public health.

And right now, it's bankrupt.

Westin: Health care was where
we all were focused

in the spring of 2020.

Dr. Charity Dean is now CEO

and co-founder of
the Public Health Company.

But in 2020, she was
the assistant director

of the California
Department of Public Health.

She was one of the very first
to see COVID-19

for what it was
and could become,

and became a major figure
in the Michael Lewis book

"The Premonition:
A Pandemic Story."

-The COVID response was
a massive systems failure

on every level--
across national security,

across civilian public health,

across the great
American companies

that hold up our economy.

We did not actually have
the capabilities

to respond to it,
and my view of that

gets clearer and clearer.

5 years later,
as I understand

just how deep
that devastation was,

I still believe that
the gift of COVID

is it exposed the problems
so that we Americans

could do what we do best,
and that is innovate solutions.

I think Americans learned
a tough lesson.

That is,
no one's coming to save you.

Westin: A 2023 Gallup poll
found that

Americans' trust
in the medical system

fell in the years
following COVID,

from 44% in 2021
to 34% two years later.

-The tension between
civil liberties

and providing for the common
defense of Americans

is the oldest tension
in public health.

It's as old as our country.

Ever since there were vaccines,

there's been the argument
over vaccine mandates.

I am not afraid of that debate

because it's the right debate
to have.

Protecting individuals'
right to choose

versus protecting the whole.

I massively support
vaccine requirements

for kiddos entering
public schools.

Why? Because the kids
that are vulnerable,

they have a right to
an education that is safe.

They have a right to attend
school and not worry

they're going to get infected
by measles

because someone else
wasn't vaccinated.

Having said that,
Americans questioning

a vaccine mandate during COVID,

I think that's just
very American.

It's who we are.
At our core,

we're rebels fighting for
our freedom,

fighting for our
individual liberty.

That's what founded
this country.

So, I'm not afraid
of that discussion.

And I understand American
parents who are hesitant,

who have lost faith
in public health.

All of my kids are
vaccinated, and so am I.

You know, the question of
employer vaccine mandates

or military vac--
I will leave that to those

more qualified to answer
those questions,

Secretary Hegseth and others who
are running those departments,

but I'm not surprised that
that became a question

in Americans' minds,
because it--

it's the right debate to have.

Westin: Ultimately, we
were relieved to some extent

from the pandemic by the
development of a new vaccine

and a new platform
for a vaccine.

Science really stepped up
in the private sector,

stepped up in the end.

Where are we today, though,
on vaccines?

That became a political issue
in and of itself.

And even today, we have a new
secretary of health, right,

who is really skeptical
about vaccines.

We have a measles problem
right now

because of small children
not getting inoculated.

Where are we with our
confidence in vaccinations?

-Yeah. I love this topic
because it's

the juicy one and most people
are afraid to talk about it.

Americans developed a distrust

of what they were told from
public health officials

about the safety of
the COVID vaccine,

and I understand.

They want to protect
their children

and they want to make
the best decisions.

And for parents,
it's hard to do that

when you don't know
who to trust.

But make no mistake,
the COVID vaccine saved

millions and millions of lives,

not because it prevented
all infections,

but because it
prevented people from dying.

Instead of dying,
they got really sick,

or instead of getting really
sick, they had a minor cough.

And so, it saved
millions of lives.

Operation Warp Speed,
that was led by

the first Trump administration,

it's one of the greatest
successes of

public-private collaboration
in American history.

What they pulled off,
that's phenomenal.

And I think we can replicate
that across a number of areas.

How do we restore
Americans' trust

in what public health officials
tell them about vaccines?

Transparency,
sharing the science,

answering the questions.

Westin: If Americans have
struggled to regain their trust

in the health care system,

they've shown little trouble

rediscovering their zest
for travel.

TSA checkpoint volume has
rebounded to higher levels

than before the pandemic.

Brian Kelly is
the founder of The Points Guy

and author of the book
"How to Win at Travel."

-There were multiple days
in 2024

where there were over
3 million passengers

going through the TSA,
record-setting numbers.

I think the biggest thing
is business travel.

You know, there was
such a huge block of

Monday-to-Thursday consultants
and salespeople

and traveling for every meeting
via plane,

and that has not returned.

Now, business travel has
returned in different ways

and more conferences,
but that has impacted pricing

because the consumer,
throughout the pandemic,

there were amazing deals
to get premium economy

and get a taste
of business class

at a fraction of the cost.

And I think what happened
is consumers got used to

sitting up front at those
discounted rates,

and now that those rates
have come up,

they're still not
as high as what they

used to charge
business travelers.

So, consumers are taking fewer
trips but spending a lot more.

That's one of
the biggest trends.

We've seen the reemergence of

multigenerational family trips,

where people are spending a lot.

Even though there has been
a call back to office,

so many people still have
those flexible work environments

and are working from abroad.

So, while traditional
business travel

has not bounced back
at the same levels,

it just looks different
these days.

Westin: While the pandemic
changed the way

the consumer traveled,

it also changed the way
companies operate,

such as hotels.

-Many mid-tier hotels have
gotten rid of daily housekeeping

and gotten rid of room service
and stocking minibars.

You know, originally those were
cut in the name of safety,

but I think a lot of that is
actually out of cost-cutting.

A lot of the industry
saw an opportunity

to cut back on their services
that they offer

and get consumers used to it.

You know, at the highest end
of luxury,

there has been pushback,
and, you know,

from my experience staying at
ultra-5-star hotels,

things are even better
pre-pandemic.

But in that
3- and 4-star hotel,

they have gotten consumers used

to not getting
daily housekeeping

or at least having to request it
in the name of safety.

And it has shown--the hotel
companies are doing incredible.

They're all growing
at rapid rates.

Westin: Kelly says
the growing push

to require workers
to return to the office

will only help business travel,

but Slok warns there's still
a long way to go.

If we go back 5 years,

almost all of us
were working from home,

something that I don't know
we'd thought about before.

How much did it change
the working patterns

and the uses of offices
and getting together

in the office place?

-And this is really
important today,

in particular for commercial
real estate and office,

including here in Manhattan,

because there are studies
by Nick Bloom,

who is a professor at Stanford,
who shows that today,

if you look at the data,
we still only have

50% of the workweek, meaning--

and the office relative to
what we had in 2019.

So, that's another way of
saying that when you measure

how many people
swipe their cards

going into office buildings,
not only in Manhattan

but across the country,
you have that we are still

only an occupancy rate
on a weekly basis

that is 50% of what it was
in 2019,

and that has had
implications for

if we don't come as much
into the office,

of course, then we don't
go and eat lunch

in the middle of the day.

We don't at
the same time commute.

Therefore, we don't use
public transportation.

So, measures of
public transportation,

including in New York City,
are still only--

For example, subway usage
is only around

2/3 of where it was in 2019.

So, working from home
has definitely changed

in a lot of different ways,
and there's also

huge, blossoming
academic literature about

does that mean that
productivity is lower?

Or does it actually mean
that productivity is higher?

Westin: Whether working from
home is more productive

or less productive,
it does affect employment

in all the businesses ancillary
to the office building.

So, there are
employment ramifications

of working from home.
-Absolutely, and that's also why

you have seen a shift also
on a sector basis there,

that there are still
some challenges, exactly,

in everything--
if you used to buy something

when you drove to work,
then people just now

at home all day long
and they're not having lunch,

they're maybe not shopping the
same patterns they did before.

Maybe they buy things
more online,

which is exactly what
all the trends are showing.

It is the case also that
now it's more possible

for people to get
a job remotely.

So, that's why if you look at
some of the job openings,

they have been putting more
in the postings

that there is much more
significant now

number of job postings
that ask for

this job can also
be done remotely.

Westin: But it wasn't just
different sectors

that were affected
in different ways.

It was different countries, too.

-I would say there was just

a good, old-fashioned
policy mistake.

-Sweden was the odd man out
during the pandemic.

Westin: And that is where
we turn next.

From New Zealand to Sweden,
countries pursued

very different strategies
in responding to the pandemic.

Where has that left them
5 years later?

That's next on
"Wall Street Week."

When COVID-19 hit
5 years ago,

cities and states
and entire countries

simply shut down--

schools, businesses,
public events--

but not every government
took the same approach.

Some went a very different way.

-I will soon be taking
emergency action,

which is unprecedented,
to provide financial relief.

-We will close our border to
any nonresidents and citizens

attempting to travel here.

-We are not telling people
to stay indoors.

Westin: Looking back on it,
can we see that

one worked
better than the other?

-Well, I do think
we can conclude now.

Of course, we all
had to make sure that

the health was
the number-one priority.

But there were certainly also
different countries,

including New Zealand
and Sweden, that also

took different approaches
and therefore ended up

having also
different outcomes.

And it has generally
been the case today,

now that we know that
the pandemic, quote unquote,

only lasted for
a somewhat limited time,

that it did turn out
to be a better situation

to have allowed
more flexibility

and not be so rigid in terms of

what the health
restrictions were.

-Sweden is one that took that
less restrictive approach,

avoiding lockdown measures
and letting people

decide for themselves,

an approach that was ridiculed
around the world.

-As a Swede, I felt quite

attacked and harassed
during the pandemic,

and both foreign friends
and media

constantly got in touch,
asking me,

"Are you all crazy
over there in Sweden?"

And we got it from,
I mean, from

all sides of the political
spectrum as well.

People saying that Sweden is
a cautionary tale.

I read that in
the "New York Times."

And President Donald Trump
at the time said that,

look, Sweden is
suffering tremendously.

Hundreds of thousands of
Americans would die

if we do what the Swedes do.

So, we were basically
not very popular at that time,

and it felt like we had
to defend ourselves.

I think many people
had a vested interest

in explaining the Swedish model

a failure before we saw
the results.

Westin: And the results,
as it turned out,

were better than expected.

Johan Norberg is a senior fellow
at the Cato Institute.

His report on Sweden's
pandemic response

found that where models
forecast a death toll

of more than 80,000
by July 2020,

Sweden had suffered fewer than
6,000 by that point.

-The other aspect is what--
is what

the Swedish public health
agency said.

Yes, we might have
more cases and deaths

early on in Sweden, but this
will even out in the long run

because no country can
completely shut itself off

unless they're a tiny island
far away from everything.

And this is exactly
what happened.

If you look at total
cumulative excess deaths

during the whole
pandemic period,

Sweden came out with
one of the lowest

excess death rates
all over Europe

and less than half of
the excess death rate

of Britain
and the United States.

So, I think in the end,
when we look at the numbers,

when we look at the data,
I think even

some of the opponents
of the Swedish model

would say that, yeah,
we didn't risk people's lives.

In fact, it worked out
better than in

most other rich countries.

Westin: Half a world away,
New Zealand took

yet a third approach.

It locked down its borders
and implemented

strict lockdown measures to
avoid community transmission,

suffering just 25 deaths
from COVID in 2020.

But it meant the country
was effectively

shut off from
the rest of the world.

Sharon Zollner is
the chief economist

for New Zealand at ANZ Bank.

-It was chaos when COVID
first hit, of course,

like it was everywhere.

Massive uncertainty about
what was going to happen.

We saw a crash in
business confidence.

We saw monetary policy
eased dramatically

and, of course,
we had the wage subsidies

rolled out very quickly.

Of course, inevitably
it was a bit slapdash,

but I think probably
the single biggest

forecasting mistake we all made,

the government, the Reserve
Bank, private sector,

was underestimating
just how effective

those wage subsidies
were going to be.

Essentially, we were
thinking of COVID

as primarily a big negative
shock to demand,

that it was going to
destroy confidence

that we were at risk
of a depression.

And, of course, the GDP numbers
were all over the place.

You hit pause on an economy
and you get crazy things like

GDP falling 20% in a quarter.

But what we learned
ultimately was that

those numbers didn't
mean anything.

All our models saying
if GDP does this,

then house prices will do that,

or GDP does that, employment--
this will happen to employment,

they all broke immediately,
of course,

because this wasn't
a normal slowdown in GDP.

It was an artificial stop
and then a restart

and then a stop
and then a restart.

The data, of course,
was pandemonium.

And it was--it was--
it's easy with hindsight

to spot the mistakes
that were made.

But essentially,
it boils down to

diagnosing COVID as primarily
a demand shock.

It was not.
It was primarily

a supply shock once you
take into account

the wage subsidy.

So, essentially,
people were sitting at home.

They figured out that
their jobs were safe.

They worked out that
they were very bored

and that interest rates were
the lowest we've ever seen.

The housing market
started to take off,

and everyone went
internet shopping.

And we saw as well as just
a surge in demand,

we saw a big substitution
from services to goods.

So, you couldn't
go on holiday to Fiji,

so, you got a spa instead.

Westin: New Zealand spent
close to $20 billion

between 2020 and 2021
in a wage subsidy program

that supported 47% of its jobs.

-The first lockdowns were
incredibly expensive, of course,

the fiscal policy, but they
were hugely successful.

They bought us, you know,
a year of normality

that other economies
didn't have.

But I would say there was just
a good, old-fashioned

policy mistake

from fiscal policy
and monetary policy.

If you look at fiscal policy,

other countries also
went all out

with the wage subsidies
and a big surge in spending,

but then they wound it back
very quickly.

We didn't.
We didn't have to

because our government debt
was very low to start with

in an international comparison.

We also had
a left-leaning government.

They had pre-funded

using that long--long--
large-scale asset program,

so, they had money
sitting there

saying, "What shall
I do with this?"

And they had a very,
very ambitious reform program

in a whole lot of areas,
nothing to do with COVID.

So, the fiscal policy remained

extremely expansionary
for years.

So, at the same time,
the--the private sector demand

was very, very strong because of
the super-low interest rates.

And so, we had pro-cyclical
fiscal policy.

We had monetary
and fiscal policy

ultimately working
against each other.

You know, monetary policy is
a lot quicker to turn.

And so, the Reserve Bank
is like, oops, OK,

inflation's an awful lot
higher than we thought.

The economy is actually a lot
more overheated than we thought.

We need to change direction.

Fiscal policy is a much, much
slower ship to turn,

even if all your weight's
on the wheel.

And it wasn't.
So, essentially,

for quite a long period, you had

monetary and fiscal policy
working against each other.

Of course, we've had
a doozy of a recession.

We had a very large
recession last year.

So, fiscal policy has also
started to turn,

but we're still
forecasting deficits

on all the metrics
for years to come.

So, essentially, the main
difference between

the economy before COVID
and now

is that our government debt
has broadly doubled.

So, it still looks
quite reasonable

in an international comparison,

but our entire country
is built on a fault line.

There's nowhere in New Zealand

that is really
safe from that risk.

And then we've got, you know,

more extreme weather
happening as well.

And we've got
an infrastructure deficit.

We've got an aging population,
like everywhere.

So, we've got some significant
medium-term fiscal challenges.

Westin: COVID eventually
did break through

New Zealand's borders
in early 2022,

and the death toll spiked,

just as other countries,
like Sweden,

were emerging from
the worst of it.

-Sweden is a small and very
trade-dependent country,

so, when the rest of the world
suffers and locks down,

the Swedish economy
suffers, too,

but the decline in Sweden
was much more shallow

than in other places,

and the recovery
was much quicker.

Interestingly, when we looked
at the end of 2021,

where economies were compared to

the forecasts
before the pandemic,

then we could see that
by the end of 2021,

the world economy was 3% smaller

than forecasts had expected.

The Euro economy was
a bit more than 2% smaller.

The US economy was 1.2% smaller.

The Swedish economy was
actually 0.4% bigger

than the forecasts
from the OECD and the IMF

expected before the pandemic.

So, it tells you
that by staying open,

by not shutting down society,
we saved the economy.

Westin: In the end,
it may be hard to be sure

which of the range of approaches
worked better than others.

We'd all rather forget about
the pain and uncertainty

of 5 years ago,

which may make it hard
to anticipate the next one

and know which way to go.

-During the pandemic era,

we had more attention
paid to Sweden

than ever before, I think,

and I was constantly asked about
what was going on in Sweden,

but afterwards, not a sound.

Very few got in touch to see
what actually happened,

and you're actually one of
the few media companies

to get in touch to think about,

OK, we all thought
that Swedes were crazy

and that everything
was going to the dogs.

Now, 5 years later,
what really happened?

You would think
that that would be

of interest to people,
but it seems like

we just want to forget
and move on.

-More bad, spooky stuff is
possible today than ever before,

but so is the tooling.

I am surrounded by a tribe
of people, public servants,

some of whom are in government,

some of whom are
out of government,

who are working on building
those solutions today

for defense, for health
security, for intelligence,

and I am ever full of hope.

Coming up,
we tell the stories

of two very different
second acts

from highly successful CEOs,

starting with Netflix founder
Reed Hastings

and how his quest for smaller
crowds on the ski slopes

led him to buy
an entire mountain.

This is a story
about second acts,

something
F. Scott Fitzgerald said

didn't exist in American lives,

but something successful CEOs
are pursuing with gusto.

Every year,
tens of millions of people

flock to hundreds of slopes
across the country

to satisfy the leg workout
they crave all summer long.

In the 2023-2024 ski season,

over 60 million people went

skiing and snowboarding
across the country,

a growth of 7% over 10 years.

And as the sport has become
more accessible

through multi-mountain passes,

and climate change shortens
the length of the ski season,

more experienced
skiers and snowboarders

are craving exclusivity...

-There's 5,000 acres
through here.

Westin: something Reed Hastings
decided to do something about.

-We're at Powder Mountain.
It's 10,000 acres of skiing.

One of the largest
resorts in the world.

Half of it, roughly, is public,

and half of it is Powder Haven

or a private skiing resort.

And it's been tremendously
exciting these last two years

to be putting this together.

Westin: You might recognize
Hastings from his

25-year tenure
as CEO of Netflix.

He joined the board of
Bloomberg LP

in October of 2023.

Hastings started Netflix
back in 1997,

growing it from
a DVD rental service

with $270,000 in annual revenue
its first year

into a global streaming giant,

bringing in $33.7 billion

when he stepped down in 2023.

-David, we're one of the areas

that is a new
neighborhood coming.

So, it's beautiful aspens,
incredible views.

There'll be 37 lots here.
That's our land.

Westin: But through it all,
Hastings maintained

his passion for skiing.

When did you first ski?

Where did you find
your love of skiing?

-Well, I was fortunate
that my mom was a skier.

And so, we skied most years
as a Christmas vacation.

But I wasn't hardcore.
I wasn't a ski racer,

wasn't all of that,

and that was up until
I was 20 or so,

and then my twenties,
I didn't ski,

and then forties and fifties,
we had kids,

and we got a place in Park City,
so, that was tremendous.

But again, I was, you know,
full time in Netflix.

I was maybe
10 days a year of skiing.

What had happened in
Park City is long lines,

big crowds, no powder.

So, we moved here,
which is about an hour away.

Westin: Do you remember the
first time you came to Powder?

-Yeah, absolutely.
It was Christmas in 2016.

Super crowded in Park City.

Drove over here and then
it was just wide open.

Incredible powder.

We fell in love with uncrowded,

the high altitude,

which keeps the snow very good,

and the community.

Very warm and generous.

-What's up?

-And then I retired
from Netflix

and then invested in Powder

and eventually started
running it.

Westin: You heard that right.

Reed loved the mountain so much,
he bought it.

The Netflix tycoon is now
taking on a new challenge--

building and partially
privatizing

a ski resort community

after identifying
a part of the market

he thought wasn't being served.

-You're only really
making a difference

when you're changing the rules.

At Powder, we're
the first one to be

fusing private club skiing
and public skiing together.

In golf, about 25% of
US golf courses,

4,000 and 16,000, are private.

And that's because
you get better tee times,

you get a clubhouse,
social interaction.

Sometimes they're
residential, sometimes not.

But in skiing,
it's really just been

Yellowstone Club
and Wasatch Peaks Ranch.

So, we're only the third
out of 500.

So, there's tremendous demand
as people move

to the subscription club
orientation.

So, changing the ski industry

is something that's
the next big challenge.

Westin: There was an attempt
here on Powder Mountain before,

which I think brought you
here originally.

Why did that one fail
and why is this one different?

-You know,
that was all public skiing,

and it's very difficult to
compete with Epic and Ikon.

Those are really
the transformative forces

for high-crowded,
low-cost resorts.

And Powder tried
to differentiate

but did not have
the private skiing.

So, I was here, just as a member
or as a homeowner,

and then post-Netflix,
I had the time

and I had
the capital, fortunately,

to really do
this transformation.

Westin: Wow do you grow
this business?

-You know, if I was younger,
I might be tempted

to, like, try to
replicate this and do them

in every state of the Union.

But for me, we're just going to
build one incredible boutique.

It's a real estate business.
The difference here is

when the owner-operator
lives in the community,

it's really driven
from the community.

So, that's true of Yellowstone.
It's true of Powder.

We're building up the clubhouse
and the club restaurants

and building a lodge and doing
other things to make it

so you can spend a long time.

Westin: Hastings has
a real estate team

devoted to the mountain,

the first phase of
a 5- to 10-year project.

-We're really
upgrading everything.

We expanded land
to be able to fit

both a fantastic
private skiing experience,

and private skiing is
600 families

get to enjoy 5,000 acres.

I mean, it's fantastic.
You know

all the people on the lift
because of the clubbiness.

There's untracked powder
days after the last storm.

It's fantastic.
And then also to have

a really vibrant public resort.

And we're building that up
over the next 5, 10 years

and really, to make Powder
a sense of curated beauty

where art plays a major role.

And so, it's the crossover
of people

who are enhanced and inspired
by art,

as well as love
the adrenaline of skiing.

-So, the Powder Haven
development phasing

is at its early infancy.

Although Powder Mountain has
been around for over 50 years,

this private portion
of the development

is really quite new
and we are just starting

releasing those units
and those lots right now.

Westin: Brooke Hontz is
the chief development

and construction officer
at Powder Haven,

the exclusive, private
ski-in, ski-out community

at Powder Mountain.

-Powder Mountain caters
to all types of

skiers and snowboarders,

from first-time skiers
through expert,

who have a passion and enjoyment
of really the sport

in its kind of
more natural forms,

because currently
on the mountain, we have

not a lot of amenities
and it's more of a natural,

what skiing used to be
and what people,

a lot of people, particularly
those with mega passes,

say, "That's what
I love about skiing."

So, people that buy into
Powder Mountain

as part of the club

will be able to share
their homes with others

through an internal
rental program.

And so, if you're a guest or
an owner at Powder Mountain,

you would be able to rent
or take part

in a lease program
with other owners,

but otherwise, know that
membership is closed.

Westin: Taking Powder private,
even in part,

has not been
without controversy,

with one snowboarder who's used
the public resort for years

telling "The Hollywood Reporter"
that, quote,

what is happening at
Powder Mountain is awful

because of
the partial exclusivity.

Are you losing any skiers
who really miss

the pure public part of it?

-Probably. You know,
it's inevitable that as

we change and add private,
it's going to lose some.

But we've made a big effort
to really embrace,

to increase compensation
for all the employees.

Open up inexpensive night ski.
It's $19 to ski

from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.

Super popular, you know,

in the local high school,
that kind of thing.

So, you know, we're making
big investments

in staying accessible and open
for people.

Westin: And other longtime
powder skiers, like Larry Wolf,

say it's worth it.

-I think it's a win-win.

He's made a lot of improvements
that I'm very pleased with.

For example, he said he was
going to put in

4 new lifts in a year,

and he put in 4 new lifts
in a year.

So, we now have
access to terrain

that was only
typically available

through cat skiing
or skinning.

The alternative being owned by
large corporations or

owned by people who don't
get it would ruin the place,

and I think he gets it

and it keeps the--the flavor

and the spirit of
Powder Mountain alive.

-The opportunity here
is so different and unique.

Not only are we at a slightly
different price point

than other private skiing,

our skiing is more massive

in terms of sheer magnitude
of acreage,

but we also have a wide variety
of ability levels.

And you're at the top of the
mountain almost all of the day

versus continuing to return
to the bottom.

So, every time you finish
your day or start your day,

you're doing that at the top
to see sunrise and sunset.

I think the inclusion of
the art installation

and how unique that is in
the world of skiing and resort

makes us more creative and
hopefully interesting to people.

Westin: That type of creativity
ultimately reflects Hastings.

From media mogul
to ski resort oracle,

he has drawn from his past life
to pursue his second act,

this time without
the same pressure

to maximize the bottom line.

-But we don't want to be
cookie-cutter.

Westin: You are investing
a lot of capital investment

into lifts, facilities here,
and things like that.

How does the money flow?
How do you cover that cost?

-Well, when I think about it,
I think of sports teams

and I think of Steve Cohen
of the Mets

or Ryan Smith with the Jazz

or my friend Steve Ballmer
with the Clippers.

And that's big money.

In comparison,
it's not so much--

not as big an investment,
but I think it's similar.

You know, for them it's
an expression of joy and passion

and winning and making
a contribution to the public.

And for me,
it's the same kind of thing,

but it's more again, skiing
instead of those teams.

And then we make money
by selling season passes

and we make money
by selling real estate.

Those are the two big
revenue generators.

The value in the long term
is unclear

because other ski mountains

haven't had that same
track record.

But I would say we're
investing, you know,

to really make it a spectacular
community experience.

Westin: So, obviously,
when you built Netflix,

it must have been all-consuming.

Does this engage you
to the same level?

Are you as consumed with this
as you were with Netflix?

-You know,
it's different muscles.

Netflix was super analytic,

super internet scale strategy.

This is more about
caring and intimacy

and making people feel good
in a boutique.

So, it's a different skill set.

It's kind of, I think,
what makes it fun.

I wouldn't want to go back
and try to do another

high-scale
internet company.

How am I ever going to do
better than Netflix?

So, this is in a completely
different realm.

Westin: Do you have
the same sense of purpose

about Powder Mountain as you did
about something like Netflix?

-It's a very strong
sense of purpose

to create a place of incredible
beauty that sparks wonder

and that people are
talking about for 100 years.

So, think of it as
a physical legacy

rather than a brand like
Netflix's legacy.

Part of Netflix's success
was a very unique culture

that really focused on
the high-talent people

and giving them freedom
to operate,

and I have brought that culture
here to Powder Mountain.

And so, for the employees,
it's an incredible opportunity

to thrive and to get freedom
and to have responsibility.

A difference is
it's much more emphasizing

love and emotion and connection
back to the intimacy.

Netflix was around
super performance

and Powder is around connection
and sparking wonder, we call it.

Westin: Coming up, we go from
the snowy slopes of Ogden, Utah

to the sunny slopes of
the Edna Valley in California

for the story of Bill Swanson,

who made missiles
when he ran Raytheon

and today makes Pinot Noir
and Chardonnay

as he runs his vineyard.

That's next on
"Wall Street Week."

This is the second chapter
in our story about second acts,

turning from Reed Hastings
creating a private

ski resort in Utah

to the former Raytheon CEO
starting a new chapter

on his vineyard
in California's Edna Valley.

-The key to me is that when
you have a lot of people

work for you, you realize

what happens to them
after they retire.

And one of the things I found is
that you can't fish for 7 days.

You can't play golf
7 days a week.

You got to keep
your mind going.

And those that had a way
to keep their mind going

lived the long lives,

and those that didn't
weren't with us very long.

Westin: Bill Swanson
spent 42 years

at defense contractor Raytheon,

rising from mechanical engineer
to become its chairman and CEO.

During his time in charge,
the company's

market capitalization went from

$12.7 billion to $31 billion.

-So, it convinced me that
I had to find a way

to do something and be engaged
after I retired.

Westin: Swanson's roots in wine
go back to his childhood

and a grandfather who
immigrated from Croatia

to grow grapes on the coast
of central California.

-My grandfather made wine
in the basement

and his red wines were so thick

you could probably
put a fork in them.

And as kids, we learned
at an early age

that my grandmother
would take a saucer,

she'd make homemade bread,

and my grandfather's red wine
would be put in the saucer,

and you dip the bread
in the wine,

and as a kid, we stomped.

If you know "I Love Lucy,"
the scene, we did it.

We had purple ankles

and everything else
as little kids,

but I stomped grapes
when I was growing up.

What I learned from him
was a real passion

about the vineyard
and about the vines.

Westin: How did you balance

running a vineyard with
running Raytheon?

-I scared my board because they
didn't know what I was doing.

I had to explain to them that

this is something
I wanted to do.

And so, things moved slowly
for a while,

and I was more of a hands-off
owner at the time,

except for capitalization,
funds, and so forth.

But then in 2015, I retired

and then, as I was
wrapping things up,

I became more involved
with the winery,

and that's when I decided that
if I wanted to move quick,

I had to own the entire property

and can make things happen
at the speed I wanted.

Westin: Swanson brought with him

to the hills outside
San Luis Obispo

his remarkable collection
of Ferraris,

all red, with a few
Ford GT40s mixed in,

memorabilia from his time
at Raytheon,

and a wealth of engineering
and management experience,

a good part of which he applied
to growing great wines.

-This is a little
like aerospace.

You can make changes, but you
don't see them for a while.

And so, as an example,
we took out

10 acres in front of Chardonnay

and we planted
our own varietals.

We will not see the product
out of that vineyard

for probably 4 or 5 years.

And so, you make
a capital investment

that you don't see
for a long time.

It's like building an aircraft.

And so, this business
has taught me

a little more about patience
than I had in aerospace.

That flag was given to me
by the Marines.

It flew in
Saddam Hussein's palace.

Westin: Oh, wow.
-Yeah, it's kind of a--

Westin: I was in that palace.

-So, you can see.

Westin: Yeah. Baghdad, Iraq,
August 7th.

-And then this is
really special to me.

That was the 2013
Boston Marathon.

Westin: Oh, boy.

-I was in Washington.

My wife was in our place
in downtown,

two blocks away from
the bombing.

And so, then we went in

and did all the security
for the next marathon.

We put in all the command posts
and everything.

So, the state police gave me
a Distinguished Service Award,

and the head of
sneaker company

gave me one-half of the shoe
of the winning marathon.

Westin: Oh, is that right?
-Yeah. So, this was

the guy that ran the marathon,
his shoe.

Westin: Jeez.

Winemaking is an art.
But from my experience

in dealing with artistic people,
you have to watch it,

because there's also some
business involved in it,

because they'd like
to be artists

and not worry about
the business.

How do you get that blend right?

-Well, that was one of
the neat things about

coming out of aerospace.

As you probably know,
I could tell you

the price of everything
in a missile

or a radar or
computer system or display.

And when I got in this business,

there's really no set easy way
to figure it out.

Westin: Swanson quickly
figured out his formula,

from barreling...

How long do you age them
in the barrels, typically?

-Typically, it could go anywhere
from 18 months to 24 months

or so forth.
Westin: to bottling.

-Today's bottling day.
It's super active

here in the lab.

We're tracking

all of the parameters
that make sure that

we're--that the wines
are in spec.

-Bottling's exciting because
it's the final step

in a wine's life.

There's a lot of steps to get

to where we are today, so,

we're bottling right now
a lot of wines from 2023,

so, it's been a year and a half
in the making.

Westin: Nathan Carlson
and Kevin Bargetto

are Center of Effort's
winemakers,

the men behind Swanson's
distinct formula

for the vineyard's wine.

-Looking at things like
the fill height,

which is regulated by
the government.

Wants it to be
the amount of wine

that it states on the label,

but also for wines that are
going to age for a long time,

it's super important
that we're not

picking up a lot of oxygen
during the bottling process,

that we have our, our free SO2

is in line to keep the wine
protected for the long term.

And so, all of those things
become really important.

Westin: All the processes go
back to one thing: the grapes.

-What's beautiful about here
is the temperature is always--

it's pretty much always perfect.

It's never much more than
85 degrees in this valley.

During the hottest time
of the summer,

at the end of the afternoon,
you'll see a big wall of fog

kind of marching in
from the sea.

And so, that makes this
especially good

for Chardonnay
and Pinot Noir varieties

that need that cooler climate.

And it helps to keep natural
acidity really tight.

It makes the wines
really have good longevity.

Everything about our property,

it's really tied to the sea.

The breeze that's
coming in behind me.

The soils were all under
the ocean not that long ago.

All of these mountains
kind of pushed

out of the sea floor.

And so, we'll find,
we'll find fossils

in the soil pretty often.

This is really--
when this dries out,

it's just kind of like
light beach sand

all around us here.

When you have vines growing
in really poor soil,

it makes them struggle to live,

and that makes the fruit
more intense.

-What's fascinating is
you learn in this business

that you're a farmer,
and there are

things you can control
and things you can't control,

and one of them is the weather.

And so, for us,
we will now start to get into

a critical period of frost.

Most people think of frost
in the fall,

but what happens now is
we're out pruning,

and pretty soon,
we'll have bud break,

and that's when we can have
temperature extremes.

You'll notice
this whole property,

we farm sustainably.

We make all our wine
sustainably.

We care about
the environment

with our packaging
and everything.

We don't get any more for our
wines price-wise for that.

But everybody here feels like

we're returning what we're given

better than what we got it,

and that's what
sustainability's all about.

Westin: What's the objective?
Is it to make money?

Is it for the fun of it?
Why are you really doing it?

-I think I would answer
in the way that

for 42-plus years, I worked
for the shareholders,

and I believed
I did right by them,

but it wasn't my brand.

COE, or Center of Effort,
is my brand.

It's something that we own

and it's something that I have
the ability to give back

and provide a life and security
to 30 or 35 people here,

or produce a product
that people enjoy.

And I think for me, getting
emails or phone calls

or meeting somebody that says,

"I enjoyed your wine.
It was terrific.

I know why you do it,"

means a lot.

And then things happen
out of the blue.

Our GM, Nathan Carlson,
showed me a photo.

I get choked up a little bit.

It's a photo of
our bottle of wine.

It's the only thing that
survived in this woman's house,

in the fire in L.A.

And she's happy because
there's a bottle of

Center of Effort that survived.

That's pretty neat.

Westin: Well, you mentioned
the aerospace training

and things like safety training.

When you came in, where did you
see parallels or overlaps?

Things--That's the way
we did it at Raytheon.

It could apply here as well.

-Jeez. Everything applied.
I mean, it was--

It was a different way of
looking at things.

When I found that diversity
of thought, background,

religion, gender,
all of those things,

when they come into a problem,

you have a different way of
looking and solving at it.

And what I found here is that

my background, the team's
background, and everything,

when you look at something,

we come up with
pretty good solutions,

and that's really the key to it

that I think that's what
everybody's background brings.

And here, everybody is what
we call part of the COE family.

The 30, 35 people
are our family.

Westin: What advice
would you give to another

high-powered, successful CEO
who's looking at retirement?

-My advice: threefold.

First one is learn
how to say no,

because you're going to be
asked to do a bunch of things

and you're so used to agreeing
to doing things

because somebody would
tell you you had to do them.

"No" it's a hard thing to learn.

The second thing is, don't
give yourself away wholesale

when you get retail.

So, do something that,
if you're going to do it,

get compensated for it,
or do it in a way that

monetizes it in your well-being
and so forth.

And the third thing is
find something

you really love to do.

And so, for me, I love wine.
Making it.

I love collecting cars.

So, I planned for my
retirement so I would be busy

and my planning paid off.

I'm busy.

Westin: Coming up, former
Treasury Secretary Larry Summers

on flipping a coin
on inflation.

Numbers for the US economy
have been getting softer,

with some economists
returning to talk about

a possible recession.

Our special contributor
Larry Summers of Harvard

has spent a good part of his
career advising presidents

on the state of the economy,

and he is more concerned
than he has been recently.

-David, I, I think we've seen
a sea change in perception

in the just almost two months

since President Trump
was inaugurated.

At that time,
the prevailing view was

very strong economy,
possibly inflation,

risk, United States
exceptionalism

relative to
the rest of the world

likely to manifest itself
in continued US outperformance.

But the combination of

substantial immigration
restrictions,

substantial layoffs

in possible prospect
from the federal government,

the damage to US competitiveness

and to US production
done by tariffication

and, above all, a big increase
in risk premiums

have led to a--
sharp reductions in spending

on the part of both consumers

and on the part of businesses,

and even more sharp reductions

in intended future spending.

You saw that, for example,
when Delta Airlines

reported a soft first quarter.

So, you take all that together.

You take the fact that
markets were starting at

a very high level
in terms of valuation,

and I think you have to say
that there's in the range of,

I'd say still slightly below,

a 50% chance of
a recession starting this year.

Westin: So, taking you
very literally about that

close to 50% chance,

for our audience, what numbers
should they be looking at

to determine what side of
that 50% we end up on?

-They should be looking at
data that points

a little bit over the horizon.

Data on order books
of businesses,

data on consumer intentions

to buy a car or to buy a house
in the next several months

as an indicator for judging

what is going to happen.

All those things taken together,
I think, will tell a story.

There's also information in

what is happening to
commodity prices.

And I pay a lot of attention
to the various compilations

that come from
investment analysts

who are very close to firms
who are reporting

which way the firms are
revising their own forecasts

of future revenue
and future earnings.

All of that are
the sort of indicators

of what's happening
in the economy.

I think at a different level,
the thing to be looking at is

are we getting
more policy certainty

or are we getting
more policy uncertainty?

Every time there's
a major vacillation,

every time there's a question
about commitment to law

and commitment to following
the law in any sphere,

you're going to be
getting more uncertainty

that is ultimately a prospect
for chilling investment.

Westin: So, President Trump
has addressed this

and said we're going through
what he called

a transition period on the way
to what he called

something very big here.

To try to argue his side of it,

is this a necessary
sort of transition

to rebalance the economy,

get the government
out of the economy

to the extent that it was,

and really go forward to
a better future for the economy?

-No. Look, David.
Transition period.

Doesn't it sound like--a lot
like the word "transitory"?

The idea of
transitory inflation,

when it was put forward by
the Biden administration

and the Fed when things
weren't going well,

didn't work out very well,

and I don't think
the idea that this is

some kind of transition period

is going to work out
very well at all.

Why do we think that
it is going to help

the US economy to not be able
to use Mexico and Canada

as a production partner,

given that we are competing
with Asia and Europe?

I don't see what that logic is.

Why is scaring people about
whether they're going to

get their
Social Security benefits,

scaring people about whether
the United States

is going to continue to develop
new medicines at the NIH,

why are those things
thought likely

to increase confidence?

If this was going to increase
confidence and people saw it,

you'd expect to see surveys
of consumer confidence

showing an improvement
in conditions,

and you don't see that at all.

I think by far
the more likely thing

is that we are
in the shallow end

and we're walking
towards the deep end,

and the problems are
only going to increase

with the passage of time.

You know, this is not
the first time

that a country got a new leader
who gave a lot of orders

and imposed a lot of tariffs.

That populist-policy mix
is a standard around the world,

particularly common
in Latin America.

And what the studies show
is that it can go either way

in terms of its impacts
in the short run,

but it's almost always bad
over the medium to long run.

So, I'd expect, unless there's
a reversal in policy,

I would expect this situation
to get more serious.

Every time he recommits,
pessimism increases.

And so, I think
those explanations of

downturn being temporary

are actually
quite counterproductive.

Westin: Larry, to play
devil's advocate, I think that

if somebody were here from
the Trump administration,

they'd say, "The transition
is to a world

where we have a bigger
manufacturing base."

We had Shawn Fain from
the UAW just recently say

he thinks what he's doing,
he's exactly right,

because we've lost so many jobs.

Is there an argument that,
in fact, we could be rebuilding

the manufacturing base
that could help

the economy in the long term?

-Manufacturing has trended
downwards for 60 years.

It has trended downwards
in Germany

as a share of the economy.

It has even trended downwards
in China

as a share of the economy.

There's a reason,
which is that there's just

lots that used to be done by
people on assembly lines

that can now be done
by machines,

and there may be blips from
one year to the next,

but the idea that we were
going to have some kind of

durable manufacturing
renaissance was a chimera

when Joe Biden said it,

and it's an illusion
when Donald Trump says it.

And the much more likely
thing is that

the particular
kinds of protection

that the Trump administration
is stressing

are actually going to
hurt manufacturing.

That does it for us here
on "Wall Street Week."

I'm David Westin.
See you next week

for more stories of capitalism.
